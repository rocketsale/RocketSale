### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Shopping/Social Networking
- **Mobile:** This application will be optimized for iOS (mobile) because of the native mobile experience that people typically expect from an app that allows them to swipe through products they may be interested in. Also, this application will rely on location and map services, which are more mature features for mobile. However, this application could also function just as well as a web application. But it will need additional UI optimizations to do so.
- **Story:**  User browses through items and selects items of interest. Seller receives buyer information. Seller can post information about products that they are selling. Application will analyze user preferences to predict future products they may be interested in.
